Hi! If you downloaded this you're probably looking to load the Microwave Dataset for cloud gap-filling. 
I've included a driver class with an example functionality of this module, but essentially everything
is handled by the Microwave_Loader class and its subclass iterator. 

My plans as of now are to be able to save all of the plots to a PDF, but for now it will spam you with 
Matplotlib windows with each iteration. Be warned!

In the future I'd also like to add a way to change the step in iteration so that we aren't just plotting
every day of every month since our starting date.
